Not even trying to hurt you just being honest and sharing my genuine experience is that you absolutely only prioritze/ care about yourself in any situation - currently lacking the ability to acknowledge feelings if it anyway goes against exactly what you want. It's what you want and nothing else. You couldn't be bothered, and if someone has an issue it's too damn bad and it's your problem, but you expect them to prioritize and be accepting of whatever you want. I feel like you 'love' me on a very surface level, which as well fluctuates daily and based on certain scenarios. It's really sad and defeating. You can't keep going through life taking more than you give. Many times I've brought my feelings up, to then just have it turn to a debate and instead of just acknowledging it, you respond with an issue you have. Never letting it be about anyone else Because I genuinely belive you don't care. You wont ask about someones feelings, youll talk over people in arguments so they cant share, I know you pretty well and usually can understand why you act in certain ways and what the core/ root of why this is. This one is very prevalent, but I just don't know why it is.  I need someone who cares about how I genuinely feel, how their actions effect me and our future and cares to resolve/ put in the work to fix issues and set aside ego. Like last night how I explained. There's never a bad time for you to talk/ come to me if something is wrong and I can help you feel better and not be depressed. I ask questions, see how I can assist, acknowledge my part in it, reassure and want to be there. For you it's \"not a good time\", when I let you know how I was really going through it. Like I've been thinking about going to see my grandma. You did the same when you broke up with me. Remember my birthday? You don't think or care about my feelings it really feels like. If I'm wrong somehow, and my experience isn't right somehow let me know.\nCollin Zack: Proving it further with the \"ughhh\" and proceeding to ignore. I shouldn't be surprised, but I just hoped for things to be different and I still got hurt even though you promised for things to be different this time. You always start off strong. Idk if it's you got what you want and then you get bored or what.   I cant belive weve talked about even having a kid together and this is how you would choose to trear me.

Find a way to do things for yourself just like I am and have and quit putting it all on me to make you happy. Example of making something out of nothing- the ring that I can't wear to work, tbag j don't sleep with on bec rings make my fingers swell in my sleep- has been sitting on your desk bec that's the last time I had worn it cause I work all fucking week. It would be on your desk or sitting on a desk in my room. Now for fucks sake pls let me have some peace and actually have a day ti myself!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I only say good things about you ever.\nCollin Zack: This is the last I'll say to you, just take this is and step outside yourself and see this objectively - make an attempt to not only focus on yourself. Please. Just once.   Stop making me into a bad guy. I wish you would listen to my needs and what I've expressed to you and all this would have been much simpler. This started with a week of you distancing, giving me the cold shoulder and responding to me and my presence negatively. At this time I was already going through some stuff and that didn't make it easier. You spent all that time on your phone and not even communicating with me.   Next you need days alone suddenly with no prior communication and also tell ne you'll see me in the morning. I wrote you a note because having that happen suddenly after a week of being ignored was tough. I just wanted to let you know I loved you and written in a note was the least intrusive I could be. Still that was too much.   I've never had a partner be this way to me. I don't understand, other than not wanting to be with someone that you need to block all communication and time spent.  Also, to make a relationship work both people need to be able to work on things and have compromises. I told you the only reason it didn't go as you wanted is because if how sudden it was and after already having no emotional or physical connection with me because all you would do is sit on your phone.  The proper way to go about this would be to communicate with me, you haven't said a word of this to me in person. Do you realize at all how this feels on my end? Put yourself in the receiving end of your actions. It doesn't feel good does it?   I don't understand it other than not wanting to be with me. Like I said. No one had ever done this. Partners have taken space, but it was done in a healthy manner that worked for both of us, and we came to that by communicating. In a relationship, it's not just 'whatever kelsey wants' is the right way. You have to acknowledge I have feelings, and those feelings are being trampled over at the moment. Need to figure out a better way of going about this, communicate with me and actually work on the relationship. If you don't want to do that. Let me know and we will figure out next steps. Because I won't be staying here.\nCollin Zack: And talking shit about me is messed up. I've never done that to you. To one of your good friends I had your back, Jules.

I kinda wanna know where you're at. I'm trying to be better with giving you space. You hadn't replied to me all day to a text I sent last night. I did text last night because the previous day you had mentioned hanging out again, but I suppose you weren't feeling well, which you replied to me in an irritated tone, which i imagine stems from you being annoyed because you wanted another space taking day and perhaps you didn't remember the night before mentioning hanging out again and you didn't want me bugging you. It just wasn't communicated, so how could I of known.   I get all that and I'm trying to give you want you want. I really am. I don't exactly feel like the same is being done for me. If you could just communicate with me I'd really appreciate it. This hasn't been easy on me at all. I know you say you want to be with me, but I feel like other than that 1 night so far the opposite has been demonstrated I feel. I sent you a message last night and never received a response still. It is me needing reassurance, which may be annoying. But given the lack of intimacy my doubts are valid.   Sorry, not trying to be annoying and this didn't need to be so long winded. I just want to explain that I want to give you anything and everything you need. I just want to know how you truly feel and ask that you are trying and communicate with me.

I have given days, when you said originally you just needed one and it's turned into this. I know a big part of that is my fault for how I initially handled it, but at this point I feel kinda fed up bc it's just a day, but then I give a day, and you still need time and even if I send 1 message I didn't give you the time and it keeps feeling like you're almost creating situations that are \"my fault\" because you want more time and don't want to spend time with me. And then you give me false hope and very clearly demonstrate you have little interest being with me. Like saying you'll come back in and I wake up to you closing the door, or when I was on lunch I was gonna come in and give you a kiss but you heard I was home and shut your door, I said have a good day and always your tone of voice with me is annoyed.  I have given you days for your space. I've remained isolated and it's \"my fault\"  I just have to put up with it, but it's okay for you not to put effort into resolving it when you know I'm struggling with it and you as well didn't go about it in the best way for me to be able to respond in the best way. You've watched a couple ep of a show, stayed 1 night - but you were already gone when I woke up, have said several times \"I'll come back in\" and it doesn't happen\nCollin Zack: But I can go ahead and wait another 2 weeks for when \"you come to me\" to receive any amount of affection.\nCollin Zack: It just hurts. It really seems there's so something more that you're not telling me. I've never experience someone being so affectionate and making me feel secure one moment and then the next needing to isolate and not be around them. Or even wanting that. And so suddenly seems ofd\nCollin Zack: It feels like a bit of a cop out, and confuses me why you even want to say/ want so much time away from me - to say you have me on mute, not open my messages, and still say that was a day I didn't leave you alone\nCollin Zack: Since we've been back together I've been incredibly happy, I value my free time, but in healthy doses that work for both of us.  I have no desire to isolate from you and make you into a problem. I thought we were both happy and really enjoying our time together.

After isolating fir 2 weeks, you say you'll come back in but you never do, say well spend time, but you wait until 2am and I've been trying for a normal sleep schedule, end up staying up late to spend any amount of time with you. Just enough for like 1 ep that I'm too tired to stay awake through. And doing stuff like saying you didn't get the time alone bc I messaged you when you had me on mute and didn't open my message. Therfore being completely unaffected by it, but instead continuing to ignore me.  All your actions have negative affect on me and you have done nothing to remedy it or make sure that I'm good. It's just what you need. And I've given you so much time\nCollin Zack: Like I want to even be excited about the weekend but I dread it. Because I know I won't see you, and I can't message you or it's another week\nCollin Zack: I dint know why you can't accept how you've negative effected me and the outcome of this. Had you balanced it. It would of been different. Or had I had any warning.  Like  remember how you broke up with me for isolating, but you turned around and did the exact thing. But I had to change and learned to balance the time I need alone and communicate that. For you, it doesn't matter what works for me. It's just if it works for you. And I'm required to adjust otherwise it doesn't work\nCollin Zack: Crazy your partner wanting to be with you is such a crime\nCollin Zack: üëç\nCollin Zack: This is literally what I'm talking about.

Then I'll leave you alone forever\nCollin Zack: Please\nCollin Zack: i hope you take the time to read this because it's coming from a place of deep hurt and confusion. last night i had a complete breakdown, and i need to get this off my chest to find some closure. we have really been through so much together‚ÄîI have loads of great memories with you and only ever wanted it to continue. but despite all we've been through, i feel like you rarely treat me how i deserve to be treated, and that only happens when we're sober. then, i feel we were made for each other. i'm going to work on getting sober for good, by monday hopefully i'm done. that's the working plan, and i hope you follow or do it with me again. I cant keep on this path. I hate to ever even say it but my depression is awful, and I battle suicidal thoughts frequently. Recently I'm glad I've been a bit too much of a pussy, but I also don't 100% want that anymore. I just need to be content, but also striving to be happy. you've mentioned that you sometimes isolate and feel repulsed by the person you're with, even though you know you love them. you think it might be something like BPD, but you're not sure. i've tried to be the best partner for you, doing and caring more than any of your exes combined. i wanted to give you so much because i thought you were amazing and deserved it. you have infinite potential, and i saw you had been severely mistreated. but even after all i do, it seems like you were more head over heels for them. it hurts so much because i feel like i'm giving my all. and if ever i wasn't and you needed more, i listened and tried to adjust. still, it's not enough for you. when you isolated yourself for two weeks, i tried to be understanding, even though it hurt. maybe i didn't handle it the best, but i felt abandoned and neglected. i wanted to give you space. yesterday, we finally hung out‚Äîfirst real quality time in a long time. you were standoffish, non-physical, falling asleep, and nodding out, ended up ditching me for a majority of it. but i let it be what it is and remained optimistic and hopeful. i thought maybe things would get back to normal. but when you wanted to \"take a nap,\" that's when i first heard the porn. it hurt a lot. only because i had made it clear to you how important emotional and physical connection are to me. that was a recent conversation, happened multiple times. we hadn't had sex in a month, and i was feeling I guess sexually frustrated and neglected. it's not even about the porn itself. Watch all the porn you want, spend the whole night doing it. I watch porn, not frequently at all. I used to, but its not uncommon for people. i'm glad you're comfortable exploring yourself and watching that. Its kinda hot. We could watch it together. Idc. The issue is that we hadn't been intimate in a month, and the first time we hang out after your isolation, you chose to masturbate instead of being with me. it makes me feel like i'm not enough for you, and i need to understand why. what am i not good enough for? what are you looking for that i can't provide? i tried to explain how much it was affecting me, and instead of addressing it, you dismissed me. then, later in the night, we were watching a show, and after you took a shower, i heard the video and your moan from down the hall. the bathroom is all the way down the hall, and i could hear it clearly. i was caught by surprise because i was caught up in my own thing both times, wasn't feeling insecure or interested in what you had going on. i've almost gotten used to you leaving and not being there, so i wasn't looking for it or had any reason for this situation to be made up in my mind. but after hearing that, i was overwhelmed and felt like i was panicking, so i needed to walk to clear my head. it's hard to process that the person you love and who says they feel the same could go out of their way to do this. not saying you're a bad person, or it's intentional. i get just being horny or whatever and maybe just not thinking far ahead to understand how it may affect me. but as i was running past the bathroom to go outside, i heard it even more clearly, and as i'm passing even into the living room, you moan‚ÄîI know the sound. there's no denying what i heard‚ÄîI couldn't have made that up. i wouldn't have brought it up unless i was 100% certain or had proof. i even let the first time go from earlier in the day, figured it really wasn't worth it, and i knew you wouldn't hear me out. it all caused me to break down. sex is very sacred to me, like we've discussed. i've felt so connected to you recently up until two weeks ago, having all that stripped away, you say you're just not feeling it, and just lying to me hurts. just always be honest with me. even if my feelings will hurt. and to hear you like that just made me ill in the moment. it sorta felt like being cheated on. but i was freaking out because i knew your exact reaction before you even said it‚Äîword for word. i needed to let you know, though. it would be a bigger issue left unaddressed, though i considered it due to being scared of this outcome. but if something is affecting me negatively, i just want to communicate. i want you to be your own person. masturbate all you want if that's what makes you happy. after what i went through with marissa, i'd never make someone feel bad for that. being able to do that is incredibly important and powerful, and making someone feel otherwise is awful. i'm glad you're able to connect with yourself, so i feel proud of you because i know your history with sex stuff is tough too. i just wanted to communicate why it had an overwhelming effect on me at the moment and to discuss the bigger issue, to see if it's truly that you would rather do that than sleep with me, as well as discuss what you need and see if there's a compromise or resolution. if something's lacking or what. because i would do literally anything with you in the bedroom. i'm not a prude. i want you to be happy. i want us to be a team. i'll always be your fucking cheerleader. i want only the best for you. i honestly am happy for you to be doing things for yourself. literally, all i ever need when i'm \"confronting\" you or whatever is just for you to tell me, \"i understand,\" or \"i hear you.\" that sounds wild, but that's all i'm ever asking from you. i just want you to know why i feel a way about something, and then i hope in the future you consider that and act accordingly. but when you got out of the shower, asked why i was so upset, but instantly, as i expected, you seemed annoyed and dismissed my feelings, saying, \"omfg, i'm not doing this, you're crazy.\" that broke me because it felt like you were intentionally completely disregarding my feelings and gaslighting me into thinking i'm losing my mind. i know you might be dealing with your own issues, but when you shut me out and isolate yourself, it feels like you're avoiding confrontation because it's easier than dealing with the consequences of your actions. you're controlling the narrative by making me doubt my own sanity, and that's incredibly manipulative. it feels like you're in denial about your behavior and its impact on me, and it's easier for you to call me crazy than to face your own issues. if this is about insecurity, i wish you could have been honest with me. i don't know why you feel sometimes you can't be 100% open and honest with everything to me. there's no subject too much or is gonna make me see you differently. is it something lacking or something you're wanting and embarrassed or scared to bring up? i'm literally game for whatever. i mean it. i've always tried to be supportive and understanding, but you've shut me out and isolated yourself, knowing how much it was hurting me. i thought i had messed everything up, and you were okay with letting me believe that, isolating yourself from me for the past two weeks despite knowing how badly it was affecting me. i need to make it clear: gaslighting me into thinking i'm crazy is not okay. making me question my own reality, especially after everything we've been through, is beyond hurtful. it has broken me down mentally and emotionally. it's not just about the physical intimacy; it's about the emotional connection and the trust that we're supposed to have. when you flip between being affectionate and then distant, it leaves me in a constant state of confusion and pain. it's not fair to keep me on this emotional roller coaster. i need consistency and honesty, not manipulation and games. i also want to understand why you isolate yourself and become cold and rude. this behavior is damaging, and it's left me feeling incredibly alone and unvalued. if you have issues or insecurities, we should be able to talk about them openly and show actual efforts into fixing these things you're aware of that are damaging our relationship, not just continuing to sweep them under the rug and pretend they don't exist. which, in a way, i don't mind doing. i can usually just accept and move on anytime because i want us to be good, and i feel each time we move in the right direction‚Äîwhich i'm willing again to do. i'm not going to scream at you or want it to be a big thing at all. i just want us. i want us happy. however, i've reached a point where i can't keep doing this to myself. my mental health and well-being are suffering because of this toxic cycle. i deserve to be treated with respect and love, just as i've tried to treat you. if you care and love me as you say, you need to be honest with me and with yourself. i've imagined a whole future with you and would promise to always work towards us being happy always. i don't know how you say things like wanting a kid with me and then treat me like this. don't make plans and say such serious things, making me feel you care much more deeply than it seems you do. but perhaps you do mean it, and the true feelings are buried under whatever all this is now.. so if you want to have an open and genuine conversation about this, I'm here, but I won't be forever. It doesn't need to be difficult. But you need to let that wall down. I can help make the talk easy. But I can't keep living in this cycle of confusion and hurt. I'm asking for honesty and clarity. If you can't provide that, then I need to step away for my own sanity. I can't keep doubting myself and feeling like I'm going crazy. I deserve better than that. You're ruining a good thing, and you need to get it together, or else you're going to lose me forever. If you want to work towards creating a happy life, getting the house with a garden, travel, love and enjoy life.  You need to admit this and choose to talk through it with me because I love you and want to work things out. If you choose to keep making me feel crazy, then go ahead down the path that's been in front of us, walking beside with the Christians and Anthony's etc of the world, and then I'll have no choice but to never speak to you again. I really hope to talk soon.", "completion": "Ooh not reading that. I'm stepping away for my sanity.

You have to understand that I've expressed my needs as well, asking you to at least come in and just say hi is a very small ask.\nCollin Zack: User unsent a message\nCollin Zack: So are you not trying to hang out at all tonight?\nCollin Zack: User unsent a message\nCollin Zack: I just talked to you last night and made very clear what I need. Open communication was one of those things, and if you want the whole night away would've been cool to explain that. Why is it so hard to give me just a little effort. Before you make it into me not letting you do your own thing, it isn't that. It's that we literally just talked about this, and I'm asking you for very little. When you got home, just to say hi- and if you wanted to not see me for the entirety of the night, explain that better so I know what to expect. Because only said you wanted to chill and decompress.  I'm trying and it's really hard because I feel like you're not really. It isn't easy for me either bc it feels a bit awkward because you clearly still feel some sort of way. Like the other day I was pretty surprised that when I came home on lunch I couldn't just lay next to you. I ask today if I can literally just come lay next to you. Don't even need to speak and that's not okay either. Feels shitty dude. You even got off early and you can't spend anytime with me? We don't spend time together because you always wait until it's actually bedtime.\nCollin Zack: At this point I feel very lost. We had just talked about this last night. It's starting to feel like my efforts don't mean anything and this is a lost cause. I cant force you to care about me, I feel like you stopped even pretending and I keep just getting hurt. You seemed to care the night we got back together, so I'm so confused. What do you want. I want this to work so bad I just can't put up with so little being done regarding what I need, and then turning around and demanding I do stuff for you. Imagine if the roles were reversed. You would've dumped me a long time ago\nCollin Zack: I can't believe you didn't even say goodnight. That hurts a lot. You even shut your door when I got in the shower. Just come to me when you actually want to be in a relationship and you get through whatever this is. Whenever you get sober. I can't keep getting hurt, do you think about how your actions hurt? Or how you're doing exactly what I asked not to happen, why do you care so little about what I need. And i even explained what a good way to approach it is, if you want time away.  You don't do that, you haven't made any efforts towards anything I've asked, like being physical towards me. I ask what I can do/ what I'm doing wrong, I get nothing. Except for you being standoffish and distant. When I haven't done anything but try to make this work.  I love you. Just treat me like you actually love me.. again this isn't about you taking time away bc i genuinely don't care about that. So please don't make it a thing that \"you couldn't have the time away because I was blowing you up\", or you can make it that, but realize I didn't get anything I asked for either even after you agreed less than 24 hrs ago.  ü´†\nCollin Zack: Would be cool if you came in in the morning..", "completion": "Yeah I didn't mean to fall asleep.

You always smell so amazing, it makes my heart flutter and turns me on like crazy. Your quirky ways like renaming everything and constantly chatting and singing to the cats. That's  just a part of what makes you so special. Every day I'm with you feels like an adventure and I cherish every moment. You're incredibly creative - the way you see the world and express yourself is something I deeply admire. Your independence and intelligence shine through in everything you do. I love how you're always there for me, loyal and strong, no matter what life throws our way. And let's not forget how unbelievably sexy you are ‚Äì you leave me in awe. Your presence in my life is like a breath of fresh air. You've got this amazing ability to turn even the mundane into something exciting. I love how you take the time to make everything around you beautiful, and your creativity inspires me to be a better person. You're everything I've ever wanted in a partner and more.   I can truly imagine my life with you, building our future together, filled with laughter, love, and all the little quirky moments that make us, us. You bring so much joy and light into my world, and I'm so grateful to have you by my side.

I kinda poured out to you a lil today. It's fine though.\nCollin Zack: Only thing is - I love you, Kelsey, but in a relationship it takes effort from both of us. I'm not going to sit here and wait around because you just want to nod out and hide away. I won't wait around for that again. For you to get sober and realize you love me again. Either love me or don't. I just need a little consistency. It sucks because we were hanging out and had a couple good nights, we had sex and I was really hopeful things were heading back in a good direction. Unfortunately, it's been like the opposite again. I wish you realized, I can be more laid back if you give me a little of what I need, and really it's just a little, kinda just your presence sometimes is enough.  I wish you realized, like we wouldn't even need to talk, I'm totally fine sitting in silence. I'd love to just chill in your room with you and smoke out and watch whatever you are. I don't know why it seems my presence is too much, and that has never been an option? I can/ am totally fine sitting in silence, or what is it? I'm confused. I'd love just kicking back, or even sleeping in there. I don't know, is it just you dont want to be around me?  I'm sorry for how uptight I've been, but like i said I just need a little bit from you and I can chill tf out. I'm easy going and don't require much. I wish you would work with me a little more and realized this. I don't wanna be difficult, it's just hard receiving nothing in a relationship, but you're trying hard - I know you know what that's like.\nCollin Zack: Or if it's something else.

It doesn't seem like you like me very much. Said you love me, but I don't feel it. You're my girlfriend, but you've said nothing to me for 2 days. We're not intimate. We were the other day and you held me and said you love me and then completely isolate from me again???? Not even Marissa fucked with my head this much dude. Wtf? why are you doing this to me. It's just like what I'm going to wait until you get sober and all of a sudden you love me again? Why can you only love me sometimes.  Guess I'll just sit here every night waiting for you, thinking of how good of a relationship we could have and jerk off for the rest of my life. No dude. You need to put in effort or we're done\nCollin Zack: We had the weekend off together and you blew me off, and not in a good way. Last time we hung out you came in, you were clearly distant from me for some reason. (I'll never know because you won't communicate.) You wouldn't touch me, ended up nodding out the entire time and then got up and left. This all after I thought things were finally going to be getting better.  We had sex and you said you loved me. I felt more connected again, I felt like you enjoyed it as well and what you said felt genuine that you really did love me. Now after that, though, you've Ignored me all day Tuesday, all day Wednesday. Not once did you try to communicate anything. The last time we hung out was last Thursday. So it's been a week, you have not acknowledged my feelings, or tried to communicate after agreeing you would. We had a conversation multiple times about what each other needed in the relationship. You agreed to what I proposed. When you get home, if you wanna do your own thing just give me a kiss and then go, is one of the things that I asked, just because I wouldn't have seen you all day and the little connection and to see you is sweet. Also if you're gonna be doing your own thing, just even communicate that to me at all. I'm not saying that to be controlling or you have to update me all the time. I just mean don't fucking disappear for a week without a single word. It's not fair to me. It's especially not fair considering the changes I made in order for the relationship to work. Remember how I fully shifted how I was and made it possible for time together? Balance. You broke up with me for not spending time with you. That's ironic, right? So now it feels like I did something wrong, you're isolating me for no reason.  I also don't understand why you don't like to be around me so much. There's been moments where you're just sitting in there and I ask to hang out and you say \"I want to do my own thing.\" I hear that a lot. Like I even just enjoy your presence. If I just wanted to come and be next to you. Not even talking. Why is that too much for you.  Even my therapist didn't have anything for that one. Just sounds like you don't like me. I think maybe it could be because you wanna just nod out and are worried about judgement, but again, you haven't communicated at all. I'd gladly sit and nod with you. But now you go in your room and lock the door. Which just feels weird. I know you want me to be more laid back, I want that too. If I wasn't deprived of and my connection with you it would be easier. Give me the bare minimum and I'd be less 'annoying'. Communicate(like that you need some space), some quality time spent(I've been trying to get you to go to a geocache that's right next to the house for awhileeee. Also sucks bc the geocaching was something you really wanted to do/was originally your idea), and some physical intimacy(our sex is amazing, I hope you feel the same). I just want us to laugh, have fun and be in love. Am I lacking in some ways, is it not exciting enough or what? We can go get it in in the graveyard. Idk what you need, but I wish you communicated it rather than shutting me out. You've been selfish, I don't mean as a person just in our relationship. I've had to do the things you've asked, but you won't give me the same.  Is it just gonna be like last time as soon as you get sober you see me again. It's not fair to me. Why do you only love me some of the time.   I know this message is long, so what I am looking for is.  1. What are your true feelings for me.  2. Why won't you put in effort towards the relationship, despite my constant efforts. 3. What do you need/ what's lacking.  4. Are you willing to try  5. What is it, when like I said I just want your presence and could sit silent, is too much and has never been an option.  6. Why do you treat me as disposable, do you see me that way?  7. What will you do moving forward.  8. Do you want to do this.  I love you, I want things to be easy too. I hate this bs. Just think of yourself in my position. You've been here. Abandoned, not treated fairly, questioning if the person you love loves you back.\nCollin Zack: If you ever feel 'in the mood' lmk Spontaneity is hot\nCollin Zack: Sorry for being attracted to you ig?

And if together - an in person conversation is necessary\nCollin Zack: My expectations if you want to work through this and stay together:  Consistent Communication:We need to stay in touch regularly, even if it's just a quick check-in each day. Ignoring each other for days isn't working and makes me feel neglected. Mutual Effort:Both of us need to put in the effort to make this relationship work. It can't be one-sided. I need to see you actively participating and showing that you care. Respectful Interaction:When we talk, we need to treat each other with respect. No more dismissiveness or rudeness. We both deserve to feel heard and valued. Physical Intimacy:Physical intimacy is important to me. We need to find a way to reconnect in this aspect. It's not just about sex but about feeling close and connected. Accountability:We both need to take responsibility for our actions and how they affect each other. If either of us messes up, we need to own it and work on making it better. Shared Activities and Quality Time:Let's plan regular activities or time together that we both enjoy. This can help us reconnect and strengthen our bond. Clear Boundaries: we need to respect each other's boundaries. This includes personal space, time alone, and how we communicate. Emotional Support:We should be each other's support system. If either of us is struggling, we need to be there for one another instead of pushing each other away. Professional Help:we should be open to seeking help from a therapist or counselor to work through our issues. Either together or individually. Sometimes, having an outside perspective can really help.\nCollin Zack: Lastly, do know I love you very much. I do hope you choose to work through this and I will be entirely committed to addressing the issues you've mentioned and do my best to be a great partner and ensure we're one of those disgustingly happy and in love couples you see. üôà\nCollin Zack: I'd like a response as to how you want to proceed tonight.\nCollin Zack: ???\nCollin Zack: http://efforts.bI\nCollin Zack: You remember what it's like to be left wondering, \"Did they ever really love me?\" It sucks to feel like that, right?

I asked and you agreed to at least come in and give me a kiss or something even just tell me about your day, or just coming in and say hey I need the night to myself at least.¬† Any display of affection, respect, or understanding of how it was making me feel. You would shut me out completely out of no where for weeks.  I asked for you to just communicate it better, you would agree to but not do it. Because your isolating was always so sudden and days later I get it out of you saying that I didn't do anything wrong doesn't feel great, so I asked you to try to find balance, as I did for you the first time you broke up with me. I never did that for a partner before. You never put in effort towards that.   2. I wish your communication was more direct about what was going on, and have compassion, empathy and understanding of how I feel. Remind me of you being demisexual, I would of understood more, but you wouldn't explain anything to me and I do have abandonment/ attachment issues, I was literally in the process of working through that stuff for us. I've been trying to work on myself, I got in therapy initially because I knew I was doing damage from feeling isolated from you. I knew my reactions to it made it worse. I was working at getting better. You didn't give me a chance and you didn't communicate, have empathy for me and wouldnt show any affection or seem to have the ability to put yourself in my shoes and understand why I was reacting to it in that way.   Marissa fucked me up - I worked through that mostly - but then you also leaving me 3 times was hard, just after I healed. So I was still actually working through that still, but you made me feel safe when I took you back because you said you were never going anywhere and you were so sorry and you wouldn't ever intentionally hurt me again.  So again, I fell even deeper in love with you because you made me feel safe. But you knew that. Still- You had no understanding or empathy for that. Why I was feeling how I was.   I saw you as end-game for me and I would've done anything to make us work. You just wouldn't communicate with me. Ignoring me for weeks and not even trying to give me the smallest amount of attention so I could feel our connection was still there. How you went about that and had no empathy or understanding for how I was feeling really sucked, dude.¬†I really love you. This is breaking me\nCollin Zack: I was working on myself, and you didn't give me time. I was working towards our future. I wanted to get a house with you and we've even talked about having a kid before. You took away the most important thing to me, our relationship. Idk why you did this to me kels.  I would've done or gone anywhere with you. You could've said fuck it I wanna go back to Florida and I would've made it happen. I don't think you understand the extent of how I loved you. I asked you to always be open with me. I genuinely just want someone to know me, and me get to know them. We've connected very deeply. I thought I knew you, sometimes I do, but sometimes I don't understand why you treat me like your enemy - when I've said I just want it all to be perfect all the time. I just have needs as well- I just want to feel connected with you. I'm fine not having sex if that's what it needs to be. And I even asked for something as simple as letting me come sit beside you in silence, and you just don't want to be around me. I don't understand what it is about me. I tried so hard for you. Selflessly gave up a lot for us to be together. I admired you, your struggles, your pain and your mind. I tried so hard to help you and allow you to grow. I was so excited about what we were.. our potential. I was so excited to one day meet your parents and have fun, new and exciting experiences with you. I wanted a fun, happy life, full of love and I genuinely saw it possible with you.\nCollin Zack: But I didn't even get a goodbye. No chance. Nothing. I've never had something hurt this bad. I love you so much. It fucking sucks. I knew you didn't get what you deserved in the past, nor did I. I thought we saw each other and could depend on each other. I only ever wanted to love you, man. Now I can't stop crying everyday.\nCollin Zack: Lastly, I did detox off everything. It was really fucking hard, I'm committed to bettering myself. I hope we can find a way to make this work. I love you so much, I don't want everything to just be for nothing. I saw the rest of my life with you. I told you I got that ring and I was gonna give it to someone when I knew for sure. It really fucked me up to find it back on my desk. There isn't someone else, is there? I don't even know where you went üò≠  Love I feel like doesn't begin to explain the intense feelings I have for you. I shared everything with you, I don't ever want to do that again. No one will ever know me like you do, and I feel like you shared more with me than anyone else.  We can live apart I guess for now it's not ideal for me at all or aidey. He's depressed and misses moose, I just really really hope this isn't the end. I'm putting in the work, I hope you can really think about this. Do you really truly just not want to be with me? When I commit I really commit. Why didn't you give me a chance, I hope we can work through this, if not I'd like to know why and what changed from when you said you'd always be there  and we would always be together.   - I'd really like to see you. I love you.\nCollin Zack: I'm really sorry I wasn't better about giving you space. If I could do it again it would be a million times different..\nCollin Zack: Would you run away with me?\nCollin Zack: Dead serious. I'm don't want to live with Wayne and I hate Eugene now\nCollin Zack: User unsent a message\nCollin Zack: Bro I'm so fucking broken to pieces bc you left :(\nCollin Zack: Do you realize how fucked this was for you to do this to me\nCollin Zack: Blu\nCollin Zack: wtf Kels :(\nCollin Zack: 2 years of being friends a year of being together. Gone. It doesn't mean anything to you?\nCollin Zack: One day karma is going to come back around dude. I need those phones since you won't say anything\nCollin Zack: I didn't even get to say goodbye and that's what hurts most. You didn't give me any closure.  You just left me, I didn't even expect it. How could you do that to someone you apparently ever loved\nCollin Zack: Hello? I'm about to go away.

I've been working on having that not be the case, because I was worried you may feel that way. I've been leaning heavily into my music, spending time outside, writing and reading. Healthy things to occupy my time. Its hard going days without speaking with anyone. I have wayne, but id rather socialize with a dog turd. It just feels comforting having you around, you make me genuinely happy - and not to be pessimistic, but thats not always an easy way to feel - I actually struggle with it alot lately. I tried expressing to you last night that i've been feeling like a burnt out looser boyfriend - like a wanna be soundcloud rapper living on his girlfriends, grandparents basement couch, thats essentially how I feel. You make the weight of the world that im feeling lately a little lighter. Getting off drugs has been incredibly hard, I havn't even expressed to you truly how difficult it is for me daily, having you around feels grounding and gives me even more purpose/reason, that the right decision was made (in terms of getting sober)  Im really sorry you've felt pressured, or overwhelmed. that was never my intention at all. i really want you to know how grateful i am that you've been by my side through this - im not sure i couldve done it without you, which is crazy because i used to be so sure of myself and self-control when it came to substances....  im just trying to do right. As well as love the hell outta you. I think a bit of it truthfully can as well be that (and i really need to work harder on this. gonna talk to my therapist about it more seriously) that when you're not around i have a geniune fear that at the drop of a pen you might cut me out and it terrifies me and lately we havn't been sexually active - you're still physical with me, like holding hands, snugs, kissing and saying you love me, which is very reassuring, but i havn't understood completly why we havn't done the dooo in quite awhile. Like since we were detoxing still, especially because you shared the sentiment in the past that when you get sober=horny sometimes. its not a big deal, im really trying to not pressure you, and let things happen at your pace since when we broke up you expressed that i hadnt considered enough that you are not super sexually active always/ had a past of thinking you may be asexual. (same btw, buut i very much enjoy our sex and am game whenever) anyways... With that disconnect, it has caused a certain level of concern, thats why i got insecure about gym bro, and expressed ive been feeling like a loser. I just fear at times that you may be currently loosing, or have already lost interest, so having you around is very comforting and reassuring. but overall i just love you, i love your company. We lived together well over a year, I miss having you around, i miss your things, i miss moose. This hasnt been easy on me at all..  I love you, sorry this is so long-winded i know you're at work.\nCollin Zack: Got phone back, and kicked it with her for a little and she smoked me out hella.

{"prompt": "Kelsey Morgan: That's cool. I'm jealous and wish I had gotten more fetty for$30\nCollin Zack: I told her it was no biggie. Especially after doing stuff today, I realize my actual desire for these drugs is very minimal. The control that shit had on me was not okay and how we are when we're sober really is enough reason in itself to not wanna go back. Since we got sober I was really craving smoking white, solely for the energy to actually be productive - have the motivation to clean the house etc . After doing it today, though it was actually super underwhelming. Which is good! My desire for these currently is veryyy minimal. Getting those last night was kinda important for me I think, really solidified that for me. It's just not worth it at all. I'd potentially have so much to loose  because of that shit.. it's just not worth it to me at all. I hated I ever was hearing shit, selling my shit, unable to healthily influence our relationship or be a good partner, and I don't want things to ever get fucked up like it ever got. When we're sober you even look at me different. I feel seen by you, feel like you care and feel it when you say you love me. All that, and as well as the potential to loose friendships like Dora and Doug, as well as have Wayne up my ass about it. Idk anyways, fuck drugs, dude. That shit isn't fun anymore. No actual quality of life. Since getting clean I'm in a bit of a limbo, but I am starting to create a future/goals that I wanna accomplish.  Want a car, want to take you on dates and experience some of the world with you, just new things outside of what we've grown so accustomed to. I wanna be able to (hopefully sooner than later) get a fuckin house. I've wanted to rent or own a house ever since I moved out of my mom's, that's always been a huge goal- i feel pretty motivated to make it happen. I don't wanna live w Wayne, and I reallllly miss living with you - and seeing Doug and Dora's house made me a lil jealous, but I'm happy for them. I want the same thing for us. I'm sure some days will still be a challenge with cravings etc, but idfk. Something about doing them again today... Nuh uh. Suffered too fuckin hard to get sober, and there's no gain, only losses to be had.\nCollin Zack: Sorry again for the long msg, just read both of them when you get a chance pls.

It's all just so wild it took me literally a over a whole fucking month of trying to finally get sober, and who knows what would've potentially happened had fetty not fucking pulled the vanishing trick out. it wasn't rehab it wasn't Buckley it was what you said is usually very unlikely to be a possibility. We fucking did it though we got sober together. I don't know babe I think our potential is way more than we choose to realize. We've had the odds stacked against us and together still always come out on top for so many different things. Fucking crazy to think about that some people never make it out of that shit. It's been too long, to me I have regret ever being so lenient and a bad influence as well. as a partner as a friend whatever when you were a year sober. We're both very different when we're sober and I met you when you were sober. that's the person that became my best friend and eventually my partner. We also accomplished truthfully way more when we were sober. Like getting a place and even just like even connecting with each other kicking it on the couch just rubbing each other's arms I loved that so much some of my best/ most cherished memories ever. It makes my heart feel all light and go doodoodoodoodoo. I'm done putting the things that I care about in Jeopardy as well as myself. It made me into a person that didn't care about my well being or how things effected you, even after you expressed your trauma surrounding things like OD's, to turn around and do that shit to you at least 4 times and nearly just shrug it off.

As well as acknowledging ways I was not a good partner in those times, as well as share how grateful i am for you and what we've been able to accomplish. i just feel pretty elated, and wasn't trying to go on about myself - I was hoping to maybe rub off a lil on you and also make you happy with the things i expressed. bc idk about you, but after getting stuff today initially i felt a little guilty- and i didnt want you to feel that. i also didnt want to really potentially seek it out again or something. i was trying to express that i now fully realize the magnitude/impact of these fucking drugs and really do believe, without them we can potentially start a chapter of life where weve never been happier, and i'd fight to make that happen and to get to be by your side the whole way through. i saw the benefit in last night. one last time, or im not gonna lie to myself, but really a last time for quiteeee awhile i hope for both of us. I'll never tell you what to do, babe. I ask you just be honest with me and share if you got it lmao. but really Like I genuinely believe you and i can accomplish anything together and im so fucking proud of you and i that i dont even have the proper words to explain it correctly to you, and we can continue this path and I can feel it in my bones that everything is going to be better than we ever imagined <3\nCollin Zack: also gotta tell you my mom says shes super proud and thankful for you too", "completion": "Aw that's rly sweet.

It was all so uncomfortable and felt very very weird I don't even know how to properly explain\nCollin Zack: And it just kept going in loops, trying to explain to him that he's judgemental, and that drugs are all the same. He said he took Adderall, but said he went in my room because he checks the bong and said he knew it got used. I was like the difference between the two, is that one is just regulated so a doctor and a politician are getting paid for your addiction. Then he's like chill with coke, and I was like how come you get to draw the lines as to what is okay and what's not. He said it's \"social accepted\", but literally I feel more clear/ not inebriated on meth. Told him he doesn't get to grade which what's on and what's not. I said \"which is okay since they're not all created equal. ketamine or MDMA. Trick question, it's whatever one you wanna do at that time\"\nCollin Zack: Then I was defending you, he just says whatever he wants and thinks it's okay because for whatever reason he has an opinion to share when I told him to shut the fucking bathroom door, and I'm like dude how many times do I have to tell you not to say anything about Kelsey. You don't know her, don't pretend you do. You're fucked up for that. You're the one missing out, and she doesn't give a fuck what you think so don't say anything, goes for me too, you're judgemental and it's gross, you've been that way towards her from day 1, line you wonder why things are tense. Why do you think it's okay for you to say anything at all about Kelsey. Idk that I can live with this dude We were in each other's faces\nCollin Zack: Definitely did not expect to have a night like this. He just kept making accusations and finally admit he knows because he went through shit it my room.  I said why is it your business. Seriously. The only reason you think you know anything is because you dig through my personal belongings? If it was happening it wouldn't effect you, had you stayed out of my personal shit. Then he's like \"IT DOES EFFECT MD IM A FUCKING ADDICT IVE OD 5 TIMES\", I said fucking same, but I don't go around trying to tell you and one up too and tell you my situation was so much worse because my fucking ego, you tell the same story but it changes. You're fake as fuck, you like to boost your own perceived self worth. You're not better than anyone, you just have the biggest ego in the room.", "completion": "Tell him to get the fuck out.

I know I haven't always handled things right, and I've realized how my approach has had a negative impact.I've got a lot of trauma around sex, which people often overlook because I'm a guy, and they assume sex is all I think about. But for me, it's always been difficult and sometimes traumatic, even when I'm trying to do everything right. I've experienced changes, so I check in to make sure everything is okay and that I haven't done something to make things stagnant. It's hard when I try to address it, and it still feels like I'm in the wrong.Sex has always been complicated for me‚Äîsometimes it's been used as a weapon, withheld, or I wasn't even allowed to masturbate. Now, because of all that, I rarely feel sexually charged. It's anxiety-inducing when it should be easy. With you, it was always easy, which was healing for me. But now, this is the second time we've gone without it, and I'm wondering if it's because of something I've done, or if there's damage from the past.I just need open communication with you. Avoiding tough conversations feels like a lack of effort, and it worries me. I'm not trying to dwell on the relationship, but when issues aren't addressed, they don't go away‚Äîthey just linger. Being clean is the main goal, but I don't think that means the relationship should be put on pause. Our relationship is part of being clean, and having things understood and communicated about will help us both.I just want honesty and openness so we can keep things great.

Sleep good\nCollin Zack: I haven't felt like our relationship was on the back burner. Since you got sober, I've felt more \"seen\" by you than ever before. Our relationship has been challenging from the start, and connecting romantically hasn't always been easy. It started off awkward as hell as friends and that had a lasting effect I believe. But when we're really connected, it's incredible‚Äîwe've had some of the most profound and loving experiences together. In the past, I sometimes felt disposable, like your care was fleeting.

The small things you do, like checking if I'm okay, coming over when I'm alone, or things like realizing I may be going through a tough time - just thinking about my feelings and then apologizing and comforting me yesterday, all mean a lot and super small things you do are honestly huge - and show so much growth.. These actions show me that you care and love me in a way there wasn't much of before, if much at all. I worried when we got back together, if I would be able to get over some of the hurt from the past, and was scared because that would cause damage. but even just in the time of us getting sober I already have gotten through so much and feel much differently and now again secure in the relationship. I still got things to work through, but I want you to know that your growth doesn't go unnoticed, and I'm not trying to hold you back. I don't want you to feel \"not ready\" for a relationship because I believe that as long as we keep growing and caring for each other, we'll be okay. I feel good about where we are now‚Äîin our growth, connection, and understanding. I no longer feel the way I did in the past when things were tough. I know we both still have growing to do, but I believe we have a strong foundation. I'm committed to our relationship and believe in us. Your love, care, and respect mean everything to me, and I know who my best friend is inside. That's all I could ask for in a relationship.\nCollin Zack: I'll always put in the work because I love you. Just keep being open with me, and I'm happy. Your message alone shows honesty, care, and effort, which means a lot to me. I want the best for us and just want to feel connected and in love. Please don't feel pressured or uncomfortable‚ÄîI never want that for you. Sex isn't the priority; our growth is.I just want to make sure you're okay and see if there's anything bothering you or holding you back. Intimacy is influenced by what we're going through mentally, and I understand that. I've been working through my own unresolved issues, but intimacy is something that sticks for me too. I notice when things feel different, and it makes me worry about a bigger issue. I love feeling connected with you on that level, but communication is key. I'll always be patient and understanding because I don't want things to be difficult between. I love you, and I'm grateful for all you've done.. I don't want you ever to feel unfulfilled. If something ever feels off, lacking, you need more of, or something new you want, I'm here for it, Don't be afraid or embarrassed to always be honest and open with me about ANYTHING. I mean it. IDC what it is. Whether it be just a thought, or something with intimacy - I want to know and makes me feel important, excited and special, when you share deep, usually difficult stuff with me.

You wrote me a very special note one time that said you wouldn't be going anywhere again and we could work through anything. I do Believe that. People fall in love and they say that that person ends up becoming their best friend. It's usually not that their best friend they end up falling in love with and I think we have a very strong foundation and I'll always be here for whatever you need and always strive to do my best. You're very special to me, it crazy I knew of you for so long. Never knew your name. Just of this \"mysterious perfect girl\".

Its just a lot a lot.\nCollin Zack: User unsent a message\nCollin Zack: I don't know why you'd get back together with me to want to leave again. Also, to your previous message - only time I called you a narcassist was to moments where at the time I had genuinely believed that. It was a time before you made me feel very loved, you ignored me for months, would shut me down, but expect me to be around when you were ready to come back, leave me at the drop of a hat, as well as leave me without a word of what I did wrong/ leaving me with no clear plan- just leaving me alone. You didn't treat me very well on fet.  You came to me this last time. Youve left me several times, please dont do it again.\nCollin Zack: I've tried so hard, and I feel like you haven't really thought about how you've affected me. Trust me, you don't have to keep saying this \"isn't your house, it's mine.\" Have you really considered how that affects me? I remember walking in, feeling the emptiness in the air, and finding all your things gone. You didn't just walk out on one commitment, but two. You said we'd always be together and signed a lease with me. You wrote me letters that I didn't take lightly. But now, it seems like your love is fleeting, just a brief moment.  You grabbed your things and ran when you had a glimpse of something better, without considering what might happen to me. In another reality, I could be on the streets‚Äîthat could've easily happened to me. Do you know how bad that hurt? Losing you was the most painful experience I've ever had. You've forced me into a situation that isn't beneficial to my growth and well-being. It's the opposite. I don't think you've really thought about how these situations have affected me.  You've left me several times, come back promising to work it out and we'll always be together. To then leave me in a more hurtful unexpected way. I had a future goal set in mind, something beneficial for our relationship, but we don't talk about the future as much now. I used to daydream about our future together, getting out of this place and into a house‚Äîit was like a dream I wanted to make reality. We even talked about the possibility of having a kid‚Äîthat's huge. I don't take things like that lightly, but it seems like maybe you didn't mean it the same way. I love talking about the future with you, and while plans weren't set in stone, they were important to me. It hurts so much that you left and didn't give us a chance to grow. You ran when a better offer came along, without even trying to explain or give things a chance to change.  I can only improve if you tell me what's bothering you. Maybe you've hinted at it over several conversations, but it never felt like it was an ultimatum. I would've done whatever it took. But instead, you got a house on your own, and now I'm not even welcome to visit. You also won't clarify things that people believe that aren't true, or just tell the truth to clear the air. That's sad to me because you're my partner. I wouldn't let anyone talk shit about you or be unaccepting of you where I live. I always defend you because I care about you, and nobody is going to come between us.  But you left, and all I could do was cry, hoping you sleep well in your attic at night with nice dreams. While you were there, I couldn't sleep‚ÄîI had nightmares. I didn't hear from you for weeks, but I love you to my core. So when you finally did reach out, I let it go, even though it was the most painful thing I've ever been through. I wanted us to be okay. I keep trying to grow, be better, and consider your feelings because I know I haven't always done right. But mistakes are part of life, and I've tried to right my wrongs and admit every fault.  I admitted and grew past the fact that I was hearing things and made you uncomfortable, even though it was a hard subject to talk about. But you haven't given me the same back. You made it seem like it was just me doing you wrong, without understanding that it was out of my control. I didn't want to be hearing things‚Äîit hurt me and traumatized me. But I grew past it, apologized, and worked hard at being better.  I also heard you when you said I wasn't considering your asexuality, so when I brought up the lack of affection and didn't get any effort from your end, it hurt. I've considered your feelings deeply and never want to make you uncomfortable. I've been patient and understanding, tried to show my attraction and love towards you, given compliments, and tried to be more connected. But your responses seem uncomfortable, brief, and almost unacknowledging. It feels like we're just friends, not a couple.  I'm putting in the effort, even through these uncomfortable moments, but it doesn't feel like you're putting in the same effort. I'm not expecting anything, but it seems like you're not really seeing or understanding my feelings. Sometimes, it feels like you're making me out to be something I'm not, like thinking I don't let you talk, or only talk about myself, or don't consider your feelings. But the truth is, I care about you deeply and often put you ahead of myself. I wish you'd look deeper and see that.  I'm not trying to work against you‚ÄîI never am. I don't want drama, just resolution, and for us to be as strong as we can be. I'm not trying to make you feel like you've done wrong, just trying to explain my feelings because it's important. If I kept everything to myself and pretended it was all okay, neither of us would benefit from that. It's okay and important to have challenging conversations, and when you do let that happen, I feel more fulfilled in our relationship.  But sometimes, and it's been happening more recently, it feels like you take these unfair, not fully thought-out positions and just run with them. Like telling me I should get a job so I won't dwell on the issues in our relationship, or immediately saying I'm playing the victim when I try to talk. Or like back in the times you isolated from me and left me alone for months waiting, when I bring up my feelings it would never be heard or cobsidered. Those things come off as emotionally charged, meant to hurt me, and shut me down. It seems like you're unwilling to hear what I'm saying, and that hurts. I'm only bringing this up because it's happened before, and there's rarely a chance to break it down honestly and reanalyze the situation. You usually stand firm in your position, even if you don't believe in it, just to shut down any conversation. It's not about being right or wrong, but a lot of it seems emotionally charged, and I don't think you always mean what you say in those moments.  Acknowledging things later, which you've done before, helps a lot. It's part of our growth as people and as a couple. I'm not trying to invalidate your feelings, but I'm trying to point out something I've noticed. Maybe you have some input on it‚ÄîI'm just looking for a conversation. I don't understand why you attack me, refuse to consider another perspective, or seem comfortable shutting me down. It feels like you're creating an image of me that isn't real, just to react to and tear down.  I've seen this before, and I don't understand it. Maybe it's a way of letting out emotions that aren't fully thought through. But it feels like you can't consider anything but how you're feeling at that moment, with no desire to hear the other side. You just want to make me feel bad or have an extreme reaction. I'm not saying this to be extreme‚ÄîI'm saying it because it's affected me in the past, and I've seen it occasionally since. I only bring it up so we can work through these things because I want us to be okay.  I'm never trying to work against you, babe‚Äîit's not like that. If you think I'm wrong on any of this or if you agree, just let me know. I just want to talk through these things with you. I wish it was easier for us to have these conversations. It feels like you're not interested in talking through the deep stuff that really matters. Especially when Fetty is involved‚Äî when Fetty is involved, you treat me not right. Maybe you ignore me for a month, say some shit you later briefly apologize for etc. I genuinely think you left because you wanted to nod. And to tell at me in front of people that I was following you..And for the past while I would give you most of what I picked up, I spent almost $1000 getting you and I stuff, or you come over and dig through my whole room without asking which I don't mind - and you have gotten us stuff, but I setup/get us good shit and you take off and give me 1 small piece. It's all unsurprising, but still sad and disappointing.   About the exes‚ÄîI won't bring it up again, but there's a reason I made the comparison. I saw photos of you with Will, and you looked genuinely happy, in a way that doesn't seem the same with me. Maybe it's just my insecurity, but it's something I've felt recently due to the lack of affection, and because of the past ways you've treated me. I often feel disposable, like you could leave me at any moment. You've broken up with me a couple of times now. And other small things, like Facebook relationship status used to matter to you, but you've actively ignored my request and want yours to say single.. it hurts..There was also a weird moment the other day when you brought up your gym bro I said, \"Do you still crush on him or something?\" and you responded, \"He was my first.\" That sat with me weird, but it shouldn't matter because I trust you completely.  But I've been dealing with our lack of affection, and it's unlike me to feel insecure. I'm confident you'd never cheat on me, but with everything going on right now, it's unusual from what our relationship has been. We never struggled with sex before, which was surprising considering what you told me from the start. So, I get in my head about dumb shit, like seeing those pictures and thinking, \"We don't take photos together,\" or \"You don't show me affection like that.\" You did once recently at Dora's, and I noticed it. You rested your hand on my leg, and it meant a lot. But it feels like you're not happy to randomly give a kiss outside of just when you're leaving.  I know I'm probably reading too much into things, but I've noticed a change. I feel like you used to talk to me more openly, and now it's like you're pulling back. I want us to stay sober, be together, and work through anything. I'm willing to put in the work, but I need to know you're with me on this.  Let's figure this out together. I'd really like to know what you think‚Äîwhat you need, want, or even what you don't want. I've been trying to show you love with little things like compliments, letting you know how much I care, telling you how you have the most beautiful face. But your responses seem almost shy, like maybe you don't like it, so I'm curious what you think. I just want to make sure I'm not making you uncomfortable.  I miss when we'd lay together, just using our fingers to explore each other's bodies. You have the most captivating body, and those moments were some of my favorite, most enchanting memories‚Äîso delicate, pure, seductive, and loving. I've tried to recreate that, but now it seems like you're more sensitive or ticklish. There are so many little things in our relationship that make me feel fulfilled, things you probably don't even notice half the time, but they're so important to me.  I love it when you play with my hair, or when you invite me to lay on your lap‚Äîthat's such a special spot for me. Sometimes when we sleep, I love playing footsie with you, or when you lay in my nook, or when I get to lay in yours. I love the long hugs, the spontaneous ones too. Also, I wanted to mention how much it meant to me the other day when you went to get coffee and came back to apologize, recognizing that I might be going through some stuff. Your support with how I was feeling about my grandma was really meaningful. It made me feel truly seen and loved.   You've started saying \"I love you\" more, and now you look me in the eyes when you say it. I think you might actually love me. ü•∞ I believe that being more romantic could really benefit our relationship. I'm not sure if it's 100% your style, but I'm curious‚Äîhow were you in past relationships? You don't have to be nervous or afraid to be more handsy with me. I really do enjoy attention from you.  Wanna wrestle? I can also give you piggyback rides. I love it when you kiss me and hold my face. I also like when we're close, touching each other's cheeks. And I love when you wear my clothes. Lastly, I love listening to you read or when you interpret lyrics for me.  These are all things I love, and they're special and important memories from the last year and a half. I just think sharing this could help us connect more, both romantically and in general. I'd really like for you to open up to me more, like you used to, because it feels like that's been slipping away a bit. I want to stay sober, I want us to be together, and I'm willing to work through anything to make that happen.\nCollin Zack: User unsent a message\nCollin Zack: User unsent a message\nCollin Zack: User unsent a message", "completion": "I barely have a speck to get me thru work tmrw", "timestamp_ms": 0}

I've been patient, waiting for things to get better, even after you've ripped my heart out by being neglectful, isolating, ignoring me for months, toying with my heart - telling me we'll be together forever and leaving me about.. 4 times now? Moving out without a word. Then coming back with hardly an apology, or effort towards what I've asked for.. just any affection to feel you care.  I've stuck around, trying to give you the benefit of the doubt, even when you wouldn't consider how your actions affect me. I've let it all slide, and now- getting no affection from you. Like not having sex or anything other than maybe a goodbye kiss for over a month.. you leave me feeling rejected and confused, making me question everything.   I've tried to be patient and understanding, giving you space to work through your stuff, but it's clear that things can't keep going the way they have been. I want us to be partners in every sense of the word, to love each other and work through whatever life throws our way. But lately, it feels like we're not on the same team. You've shut me down, pushed me away, and treated me in ways that feel like echoes of your past traumas, not like someone who values and cares for me. I've stood by you, even when it felt like my heart was being torn out, hoping that things would get better. But every time you yell at me, shut down, or tear me down without reason, it just reinforces the feeling that you don't see my worth or how much I've done for you. It hurts that you can't acknowledge the effort I've put in or the patience I've shown.   And yet, here I am, still willing to work through it all with you. But I can't do this if you keep treating me like I'm disposable. You've been rude, dismissive, and downright hurtful, and I've had enough. I've spent months waiting for you, changing, growing, and hoping that you'd see how much I care. But if you can't acknowledge any of it or treat me with the respect I deserve, then I'm done. All I ask for is a little effort - and then I'm willing to give you anything you ask. You've said that you're uncomfortable with how you've treated me, but actions speak louder than words. If you can't start treating me like a partner‚Äîsomeone who's on your side and not against you‚Äîthen I'm walking away for good. I've already spent too much time waiting for you to come around, and I won't wait forever. This is it, Kelsey. I love you, but you need to decide if you're willing to make the changes necessary to move forward together. If not, then I'll take that as your answer, and I'll move on with my life without you.\nCollin Zack: I'd love to see you soon, but really. I need the way you treat me/your approach to the relationship to be different. I don't think it's a crime to want to be intimate/ feel connected with you, or not be disrespected by you. If you put the effort into what little I ask. You'll see improvement as well in me doing the same back. I'd love to hear you out on what you need as well. I've been listening and will provide you anything you need whether that be space to grow and stick with sobriety etc. I want us both to be healthy and successful. I just need to feel that you actually love me. I'd like to see you. I hate how things left off. That was awful. You really hurt me.

{"prompt": "Kelsey Morgan: Thank you\nCollin Zack: Hey Kels,  I don't know if you'll ever read this. Maybe you won't even want to, or maybe you'll just skim it and move on. But I can't keep all this bottled up anymore. I keep feeling like I need to say something‚Äîanything‚Äîto help with the emptiness I've felt since you left. Maybe this is just for me, but a big part of me hopes that, even if it's only for a second, you'll feel something too.  I won't lie to you‚Äîit's been brutal. Some days feel easier than others, but at night, when the quiet creeps in, I keep replaying it all in my head, trying to understand how we went from being everything to... nothing. It's like you just disappeared. One day you were right there with me, and then, all of a sudden, I was left holding my chest, heart in a million pieces‚Äîand just as many questions. I thought if there was ever anything wrong, we'd talk about it, like we promised each other. I thought I'd see it coming. But instead, without warning, you were just... gone.  I can't stop thinking about when we met. My memory isn't what it used to be. My last overdose‚Äîbeing out for 15 minutes‚Äîwell, it did something. But I remember you, every detail with you. I remember how you'd light up a room, how you'd draw people in (for better or worse) and I was no exception. From the moment I met you, there was this pull. I remember thinking, \"This girl has something different.\" And it wasn't just some fleeting first impression‚Äîit was real, something that stayed and kept growing. The more I knew you, the deeper I was in. Every little thing you did felt like a piece of something bigger, and I've never felt that way with anyone else. You weren't just someone I'd end up falling for. You were my best friend.  When we got together, I honestly hadn't seen you that way at first. You were just my best friend. But that night, when you took my arm, I felt something I didn't even know I was capable of feeling. It was that \"butterflies\" thing everyone talks about‚Äîbut so much more. I knew, in that moment, you were everything I'd been looking for. In those early days, I felt you loved me; I could see it in the way you'd look at me, in how we'd lie together, tangled up for hours, just tracing lines along each other's arms, talking without words. I'd never had that with anyone‚Äîthat feeling of warmth and calm, like I could be with you in this silent, perfect understanding. It wasn't just physical; it was deeper, like we'd tapped into something rare. And I didn't even think that kind of connection was real until you. You felt like the most important person in my life, like I'd found something irreplaceable.  And I know I didn't make it easy later. I believe things started to shift for you when we both lost our jobs, and I pulled away. I can't blame you for being hurt by that. But the moment I realized what I was doing, I knew I had to change. I wanted to be better, to show you I was all in. I wanted you to feel like you could rely on me because I saw a future with you. I wanted us to work. I know I wasn't perfect, especially during the times when I felt you pulling away. I know I could've been better, but I tried to be there for you, to be what you needed. I feel like, after that, you never fully came back. There were moments, but something felt missing. And it hurt, never really having you fully present again, always wondering what I could've done differently.  I keep thinking about all the things we planned, all those \"someday\" dreams we stayed up late talking about. The little things, like road trips to nowhere in particular, watching sunrises we shouldn't be awake for, or spending a whole day just getting lost in each other's company. We had all these \"somedays\" that felt like promises, and I still catch myself picturing what those days would've been like.   One thing that always got to me was how much I admired you. Everything you went through, the strength you held onto despite it all‚ÄîI was in awe. I knew your past wasn't easy, that people had let you down, that you didn't have the support you deserved. But you still kept going. You opened up to me, and I can still remember how it felt to hear those pieces of your life. It meant something, knowing you trusted me with that. I wanted to be the one who wouldn't disappear when things got tough, to show you what it's like to have someone you can count on. Being by your side, helping you grow, showing you parts of yourself you might not have seen‚Äîthat meant everything to me. I loved seeing you light up, seeing you smile, like you were rediscovering yourself. You brought this purpose into my life, like I was right where I was supposed to be, right by your side.  You weren't just my partner‚Äîyou were my best friend. Losing a friend like that hits differently. It's this deeper kind of ache, like I've lost a part of myself I only opened up with you. You were the one person I could say anything to, without judgment. It's not just that I lost someone I loved. I lost the one person who really knew me. It's that feeling of losing you that doesn't go away, it echoes. That deep sense that I may never find that closeness with anyone else.  And it wasn't just the big things. It's all those little quirks that made every day feel lighter, like the silly nicknames, the goofy laughs. I miss hearing you call me \"chicken\" or \"Aidey Sue,\" or how you'd help me look for my helmet every time I misplaced it. Sometimes you'd make me laugh over the most random things, like \"and I've always said that.\" It's like you had this way of snapping me out of my head, making me feel like I could be... me. Being around you was like being with... well... my best friend‚Äîsomeone who made the world a little less heavy, just by being there.  Now, it's just... quiet. This silence that feels almost louder than when you were here. I keep hoping I'll hear from you, just to know you're okay, that maybe, somehow, we're okay. But I know I can't keep my life on hold. There's this emptiness where you used to be, and I don't know how to fill it. Moving forward has been hard, with memories that keep coming back, hitting harder than I ever thought they would.  I remember how you'd look at me sometimes, like you could see right through everything I'd built up. It scared me, but it was also like you were giving me permission to let go, to just... be. I miss that feeling‚Äîthe feeling of being understood without a single word. It's something I never thought I'd find and now that it's gone.  So, I'm writing this to let some of it out, to say what I couldn't say before. I needed to tell you this. For me, what we had was real. I'll hold onto the memories, the laughter, those nights when it felt like we were the only two people in the world. I wanted so much more for us, something that could last, something that wouldn't just fade away.  I hope you're okay. I hope, deep down, that a part of you remembers what we shared, that it meant something too.", "completion": "Of course it meant something to me, of course it was real.

It sounds like they've really been a lifeline.  I didn't reach out with anything specific‚ÄîI just really miss you. You've been on my mind a lot, and I wanted to check in, see how you're doing, and let you know I'm here, always.\nCollin Zack: I've realized there is something specific I need to ask. I don't understand why things ended the way they did, or why they played out the way they did throughout the relationship. Why did you make those choices, and how did I deserve what happened? I can't shake this feeling that, at times, you saw me in a light I didn't understand, like I was somehow the problem.  It's hard to put into words, but I felt off-balance, like I was questioning myself in ways that never made sense to me.

I want the best for you, truly. But I'm trying to understand why things ended the way they did. The way it all happened, with the back and forth, was really confusing and painful. It felt like I was holding onto hope and trying to be there for you, but then you suddenly pulled away without much of an explanation. You moved your stuff out, got back with me, then the last day I saw you was after an OD, and you screamed at me telling me to stop following you. Then while waiting for 9 days for a chance to see you - and you saying things like I miss you, wish you were here etc, the day I thought I may have a chance to see you finally, you break up with me. With not much details.. I always wanted to give you anything you needed. You just needed to communicate. If getting sober was a deal breaker, or you needing extra space - I wish you would of said that and tried to work on things with me, like you said you would.

I cared about you more than you know, I wish you would've ever been more willing to work on things and communicate. I really tried I feel for you, and you gave hardly an inch. It just sucks, because I know even when we were together you even talked shit about me - like, I was seeing this girl, and apparently we met her when we were doing fetty. We met her at that dudes house down the road, the one who ripped you off. I met you down there, and eventually left and you stayed chatting with her and saying things like I'm annoying and clingy.  All I ever wanted was your company. I even asked to just sit in silence with you before. Or just come in and give me a kiss and tell me \"hey I need tonight alone\" and you would choose ignore what I said I need and you did not seem to care much about my feelings at all, or putting any effort. I loved you, and I feel like you took it for granted.

You knew my traumas with Marissa, I know I didn't handle the you needing space well, but it was confusing because you broke up with me because I wasn't giving you enough attention and isolating and it tapped into those abandonment traumas.

You talk about relationships ending and people getting hurt, like that's all it was‚Äîas if I'm 'playing the victim' for even bringing up how much this affected me. But the reality is, I did a lot for you. I was there, fully in it, even when you would come and go as you pleased, like I was just something you could pick up and drop whenever.  You promised me that if anything came up, we'd talk through it, that you'd always be there. I held onto that promise, but when things got hard, you just disappeared. All I ever asked for was that no matter what happened, we'd at least still be friends. You were my best friend, and I trusted you when you said you'd be there, but in the end, it feels like you walked away without a second thought.  You make it sound like all this was inevitable, like it's just 'life,' but that's not how it felt on my end. I was left questioning myself, wondering if I was doing something wrong, trying to be there for you, support you, even when you weren't willing to do the same. It's hurtful that you think I owe you nothing but silence when you're out here acting like the choices you made didn't have any consequences. You might say it wasn't personal, but it was personal to me because I actually cared.  If you can't even acknowledge that, then maybe this is where we really are different. I'm not trying to make you 'owe' me something. I'm trying to make sense of why you acted like I was disposable when I was there for you through everything.  I get that what I went through wasn't easy on you‚ÄîI'm not pretending it was. But you act like I just decided to go through psychosis for fun, and that what I went through didn't affect me too. That period was incredibly painful for me, and I know I put you through a lot, but it's like you're ignoring the context. The whole reason I was struggling like that was because of my trauma, and in the middle of it, you were abandoning me. I know it was hard on you, but it wasn't exactly easy for me either. It hurt a lot, and it took everything I had to get past it, to apologize, and to grow from it.  I don't forget what happened‚ÄîI carry it too, every single day. And yes, I was in a bad place, but I did my best to own up to it afterward. I didn't want that to happen, and I didn't want to put you through it. But it feels like you see me only through that one lens, like I'm defined by the hardest time in my life. You even went as far as having people come to threaten me, and I don't know how you think I'm supposed to feel about that. You say it was traumatic for you, and I get that, but it was just as painful for me. And while I tried to move past it, apologize, and grow, it seems like you never let it go.  You talk about the trauma I put you through, but what about the pain of being abandoned right when I needed someone to lean on? I was doing everything I could to show up for you, but it feels like I was just someone you could discard when it got hard.  I'm not saying it was easy for you, but I don't feel like it was ever easy for me either. I put in the work to make things right because I cared about you and wanted us to get past it. But it feels like, for you, I was never worth that same effort.

{"prompt": "Kelsey: Yeah we both have handled things poorly. I think a fresh start is a great idea if you‚Äôre down\nCollin: Felt too pussy to say in person- sorry for the novel:\n I agree that we have both made mistakes and things have become strained between us. There‚Äôs an issue though and I have to be honest/open with you and I always will be  - I understand that you no longer want a romantic relationship. I respect your decision - needs to be known though I still have romantic feelings for you and those emotions have not changed despite our recent conflicts.\nThat being said I can‚Äôt help but hope that maybe circumstances could change and the possibility of a romantic relationship could be revisited. I really wish we could be snuggling up at night, making fun of movies, going on dates and traveling. I still never showed you a lot you haven‚Äôt seen - even just near by! I understand that maybe it‚Äôs uncertain and dependent on various factors, but I wanted to express my genuine feelings because I feel I could be the best partner you have had and I kick myself because I never tried. At the beginning we just jumped in and I was still mildly not over Marissa and the recent of us both having ended relationship AND also working together just made everything hard and a bit awk at times, so a large portion of the time it felt almost like we weren‚Äôt even dating.\nThe bigger issue was in myself though. I felt as though I had a lot of loss (band, job etc) and nothing could go right and I was super unhappy, so the isolation doing music is a coping mechanism for me. I don‚Äôt have to think about anything else and I can do it for hours. It wasn‚Äôt exactly the drugs doing that  (just made it really easy to stay awake)- I‚Äôm aware of it, but didn‚Äôt wanna admit I guess because I was just letting things keep falling apart around me. I felt defeated. I used to be pretty self aware and handled situations really good and was big on improving myself always. But Because of all that i developed a very ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt give a fuck everything is fucked anyways‚Äô attitude. Lost joy in everything. I stopped being as funny and whitty, which I always liked about myself. Just became sorta a shell. Now though I‚Äôve realized and am moving far away from that. I don‚Äôt want to be that person so I‚Äôm going to be the best variant of myself I can be.\nAnyways, all that said.

{"prompt": "Kelsey: What did you say to Joe?\nCollin: Joe who", "completion": "Joe at TokyRoll", "timestamp_ms": 0}
{"prompt": "Kelsey: Joe at TokyRoll\nCollin: Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the opportunities I had while working at Tokyroll, and for the chance to share my thoughts with you. Please know that I understand if you choose not to read this, but I felt it was important for me to express my feelings.\nThroughout my tenure with Tokyroll, I invested a significant amount of effort, particularly during its early stages. I took great pride in being involved with the creation of VRC, as it was like my own child. I hold no ill will towards you, in fact, I have genuine respect for you. When you joined the company, you were straightforward and demonstrated your competence, which I greatly appreciated and admired. Despite personal challenges, your leadership made me feel comfortable and valued, fostering a positive work environment. Your genuine patience had a profound impact on me and allowed me to grow both personally and professionally. But you stopped showing up as frequently.\nFrom a business standpoint, I can understand why you made the decision you did, based on the information you had available. However, I believe there might be certain aspects that you are not aware of. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for giving me the opportunity to return to the company. It allowed me to explore my true aspirations and seek a career better suited to my skills, rather than remaining in the food service industry - Like the last time we saw eachother I believe you said something about valuing your office and your cozy space. I value that and my heart is with something more music/tech/ sales. Moreover, I faced challenges in my personal life while working with an ex-partner and struggled with addiction. I want to assure you that I don't hold you responsible for these circumstances, and I apologize if I failed to meet your expectations. After being demoted and having someone new take over the store, which I had invested so much in, I faced significant hurdles with limited resources at my disposal. Nevertheless, I remained committed to its success and consistently went above and beyond, ensuring everything was in order for Austin. Although I personally liked Austin, his slower pace and occasional focus on unnecessary tasks made me concerned. I offered advice on a few occasions, drawing from my extensive background in kitchen management, but was often met with resistance. Despite these challenges, I respected my position and suppressed any ego, although it was disheartening to be treated differently. It seemed as though Kelsey received preferential treatment, likely due to her ability to connect with people with a 'quirky' personality. However, I never intended for it to become a competition. My sole desire was to see the store flourish and improve, and I offered suggestions only when I believed they would benefit the entire team. These were not trivial matters, but rather practical improvements..\nFurthermore, if my shortcomings, such as sitting on the clock, were clearly communicated to me, I would have made a concerted effort to address them. I was under the impression that it was acceptable, bruce brought in the bench and said we could use us - I didn't know it was an issue, especially since I remained in the front where I could still attend to customers. In contrast, I noticed Kelsey often retreated to the back, engaging in personal activities like eating and taking extended breaks to smoke. Although I took my required breaks and sometimes returned late due to traffic, I don't want to offer excuses. The truth is, I felt somewhat demotivated and isolated within the team due to our differing interests, particularly in discussions about TikTok and politics. If you had voiced your concerns, it would have meant a lot to me, as I always prioritize the well-being and success of the businesses I work for, especially when I hold respect for the individuals involved. Tokyroll held a special place in my heart, as I witnessed its inception and growth, starting as a regular employee and eventually becoming a DM overseeing multiple locations, often working seven days a week. I was especially hopefully and truly believed in the changes you made. The new menu and the arranging of the building is truly amazing.\nLastly, I want to clarify the situation regarding my interview. I was given the impression that Kelsey held an assistant manager position. Therefore, I communicated with her two days in advance to inform her of my intention to take my normal lunch break at 12 - noon, rather than the usual 1 or 2 p.m. Even when she arrived, she reassured me that it was acceptable. Consequently, I was surprised when I arrived at work and discovered it had become an issue. I regret not having had the opportunity to discuss this matter further with you before such a drastic decision was made. Nevertheless, I wholeheartedly respect your choice, and I genuinely wish you the best moving forward.\nPlease understand that I bear no grudges or hard feelings. I wanted to express my gratitude for the time I spent at Tokyroll, and to share my thoughts and experiences. Thank you for taking the time to read this message.\nCollin: That was a perfect setup for a Joe mama.

I really was inspired by your motivation and drive for music. I know you wanted it to work out too, but seeing the apology text you sent Rina a while back really just spun me out. You said you had sent me long text about shit you were going through and that I had just dismissed it and wasn't there for you, that really fucked me up. I tried my best to be a good friend to you, to be there for you when you needed to talk but it often felt like a one way thing. The apology felt like you were on the brink of mending shit but then just shifted blame onto everyone else. I get it, the sudden move was a lot to deal with but there was a lot of stress in our whole dynamic as a band. I hate lying to people and having to try to keep that fact that you never actually quit coke from Gabe made me uncomfortable. I didn't want our friendship to fade after everything started going to shit and it just put even more stress on me when I was already drowning in my own problems. I hope everything can get worked out but it just seems we're in limbo between current life and how things used to be. It's sad to see the videos now dude, there's so much potential and I wanted you to come with us, I really did. You don't know how many times I argued on your side of things throughout the time the band was together, that just made it hurt more to see that you think I wasn't there for you.\nI'm just fucking rambling into my phone now because I don't know where to go from here. I'm not good at letting friends go and I don't want that to happen, but fuck man you hardly ever let us know what you were dealing with or genuinely wanted to know and listen to what was going on with us. Correct me if you think I got shit wrong but this is just how I've been feeling. Wish you the best man, truly\nCollin: I sent gpt every message and it analyzed all of them and said\nYour message to Marina doesn‚Äôt necessarily come across as shifting blame. It‚Äôs more of an emotional expression and an attempt to explain your feelings and perspective. You did mention that you wish they had taken more responsibility in seeing you as part of the family and reaching out to you, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like you‚Äôre blaming them for everything. Instead, you‚Äôre sharing your thoughts, regrets, and the impact their actions had on you.\nIn your message, you also express appreciation for the band and your time together and acknowledge the positive qualities in Marina. It seems like you‚Äôre trying to communicate your emotions and concerns rather than placing blame.", "completion": "He doesn‚Äôt like lying about you doing coke but he lies to Marina about hitting up some random girl?

There‚Äôs nothing I could come up with that was really good, because my mood about it changes. So I‚Äôm gonna ramble a bit.\nI love you guys. It hurt I got left behind, but what can you do. I understand it sometimes, but I do also wish you guys would‚Äôve been there for me a bit more like I was for you all, and so sometimes I‚Äôm really angry about it. I know it ‚Äòwasn‚Äôt your job‚Äô and maybe it ‚Äòstresses you out too much‚Äô, but I have had moments where I was actually really struggling. I needed my only people to have my back. Now I have nothing, which is fine, but you guys leaving felt like one of the only things that mattered to me was ripped away, also lost my job at the same time. Bad combo..\nOur music journey was a wild ride, and I always considered you more than just a bandmate ‚Äì you were a friend, a brother I could trust. But, there was some instances that I cant ignore, and they‚Äôve left me feeling kind of let down. One of those moments was when you started dating Marina, despite the rule we had against it within the band. Look, I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs the end of the world that you guys dated, but it was an example of not being much of a friend or a person of your word. You gave me your wooooord. We set that rule for a reason, and seeing it broken felt like a lack of respect for our agreements. I needed my friends to have my back, especially when decisions could affect our group dynamic. The music meant everything to me, and when you guys were dating, it felt like things slowed down on that front. Friendship, to me, is about trust and support. I felt like we had a disconnect during that time. It wasn‚Äôt just about the rule itself it was about the impact it had on our group and our friendship. I believe that true friends should prioritize each other‚Äôs feelings and be open about decisions that could affect the dynamics of the group and eachother, but outside of that you lied to me and your priorities really switched up. I never gave you a reason to be dishonest with me, I only ever tried to help you to be yourself and allowed you opportunities to do that as well. I only ever wanted the best for you. I‚Äôm pretty wise (though self destructive) so I tried to instill tough lessons I had to learn the hard way. I had a bit extra life experience, and it was nice seeing some of the advice from hard lessons I learned actually help you. I saw a bit of me in you, we had shared some pretty similar fucked up experiences in the past. It was amazing finding someone that understood and liked so much of the same shit. - Idk I just felt hurt - thought we were able to be open with eachother about whatever but that slowly shifted.\nNowwww leading into Another thing that bothered me. The double standard regarding substances. It felt like doing substances was okay if you wanted to do them, which didn‚Äôt sit right with me. It‚Äôs one thing to have personal choices, but it‚Äôs another when it feels like there‚Äôs a different set of rules for different people in the same circle. For me, It‚Äôs about individuality and having the freedom to make our own choices, especially when it doesn‚Äôt impact the band negatively. I take my freedom seriously. I was the old man of the group. I don‚Äôt gotta listen to u tweens. But y‚Äôall don‚Äôt got to listen to me neither‚Äô.\nOne more thing I wanted to mention is that I often felt left out. It seemed like plans were made without me- like when hanging out outside of the band. which I get a bit bc gabe+lily, you+marina. Idk just felt a little lame sometimes.\nI‚Äôm not bringing all this up to dwell on the past, but to provide you with some insight into why I‚Äôve felt a bit disappointed. I treasure our friendship and all the great times we‚Äôve had together, and I hope we can have an open conversation about these feelings and if possible find a way to rebuild the trust and whatnots we once shared.\nI‚Äôd really appreciate hearing your thoughts on all this when you have the time.

{"prompt": "Kelsey: You here?\nCollin: Love ya lots. Hope we can spend some time together soon..\nCollin: Hey,\nI‚Äôve been thinking a lot, and I wanted to share my feelings with you. I understand and respect your need for space, but I also want you to understand where I‚Äôm coming from. This is not meant to overwhelm you or anything, I‚Äôd just appreciate if you read and kept an open mind. <3\nFirst, I want you to know that I love you deeply. I‚Äôve fought for our relationship, and I‚Äôm committed to continuing to do so. We‚Äôve talked about being together for a long time, and I‚Äôm determined to make you happy. Lately though I‚Äôve been feeling pretty hurt. It seems like feelings may not be reciprocated, or maybe we express them differently. I‚Äôve been going through some tough times, even dealing with some very dark thoughts and during those moments I just wanted to be with you - just to be in your presence, even if it was just watching TikToks together. Unfortunately it‚Äôs felt nearly impossible to connect on that level recently.\nI understand the need for space and solitude, believe me, it helps me too. It‚Äôs a part of why we broke up before, and I‚Äôve worked hard to adjust my routines to make room for us. But it seems that you‚Äôre not willing to do the same now that the tables have turned.\nYou may also remember we had kind of a recent breakdown when I got caught up in my music for too long and you felt left out that one night. We resolved it and I extra worked on my routine, and I really felt we moved in a direction of being more connected and it was a positive. I felt like you really cared, which was great bc I love the fuck outta you.\nBut really since after that.. idk what happened and it‚Äôs just now, when I need you, I feel like I‚Äôm left to navigate through it on my own. I‚Äôm not trying to solely rely on you. I just need my partner there sometimes..\nI think what makes this so challenging is really the amount of time that has passed since we shared quality time together. It‚Äôs been over a month since we were intimate, and this emotional distance is starting to take a toll on me. I long for you. It‚Äôs been since you got sick, and I think you‚Äôve kissed me like 3 times in the time frame and nothing else.\nI want to emphasize that I‚Äôm not trying to criticize you or put you down or anything like that. I‚Äôm just looking for clarity about where you stand and how we can move forward together. I feel I‚Äôve been in the dark for a long time and need something..\nI promise to be patient and give you the space you need. This message is a step in that direction, so I won‚Äôt keep bringing it up and it‚Äôs just out there.  I love you deeply, and I‚Äôm determined to work through this. I miss you so much that it hurts.\nplease know that I‚Äôm here, waiting and hoping for us to find our way back to each other.\nCollin: ‚ù§Ô∏è\nCollin: Do you have $120?\nCan get the phones turned back on.", "completion": "I have like 100 I‚Äôm so broke after rent", "timestamp_ms": 0}

{"prompt": "Kelsey: Sorry food", "completion": "Dood", "timestamp_ms": 0}
{"prompt": "Kelsey: Dood\nCollin: All g\nCollin: (Eyy sorry it‚Äôs so long)\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what‚Äù -she\nHope you take the time to read this.\nI really enjoyed your company the other day, I wish it was always that way (and it could be).\nI feel I have remained patient and thoughtful of the space you need and going about everything in a way where it didn‚Äôt turn out being super awkward. I need you to know, I‚Äôm still really hurt and today missing you feels incredibly heavy.\nBecause you kinda broke up with me, but also not explicitly? (So guess you‚Äôre still my girlfriend, fag. lol)\nEvery time I fall in love it hurts. It takes so much, but when I‚Äôm there I‚Äôm completely invested and will do everything in my power to make it work.\nI‚Äôm unlikely to ever be the one to leave. When people leave it hurts. I can‚Äôt think of anything that hurts more, really. I‚Äôm getting better at getting left which in itself is sad, but I end up feeling disposable and confused because I try my best and give my all. I love deeply, I‚Äôm easy going, only want the best for my partner and ensure that their needs are met. I don‚Äôt want problems and I want what they want. Still, for whatever reason I‚Äôm just not it. It‚Äôs so confusing to me- if I was some asshole, narcissistic cheater. Sure. That would make sense, but I‚Äôm just not that and I‚Äôll work with the person I love on pretty much anything they need.\nThis just happened completely unexpectedly and hurts at times worse because we were great, but you got sick, stayed in your room and then just continued staying in your room and also because I had worked on all of which you asked of me after the first time you broke up with me,  ironically was mostly for the isolation. This matters enough to me though that i would continue to work on anything you needed from me, in whatever ways it took. I felt we were both way more invested and it was easy this time around. Every guard I had in place was nearly non existent for once. I‚Äôve never had that. I think back to that night we both were crying, when you left and came back. It was really impactful, I felt genuinely that you loved me when you said it then. I knew that this is right and worth fighting for. It was communicated beautifully, we both were understanding and acknowledging faults on both ends, you had a hard time starting the conversation, but I don‚Äôt, so we balance out and once we‚Äôre able to talk about something it‚Äôs cleared up so easy, then we just snuggled. We both generally want/ share the same thoughts on matters. When things end it has never felt I had a say in it at all. Which is why you would be getting huge messages etc, which I need to learn to control. I did a bit better this time I feel. It‚Äôs just such a lost and terribly hopeless feeling completely out of your control. It‚Äôs hard especially when I only want the best for us, have really no expectations and prioritize freedom because we‚Äôre aware of each others pasts. I just ask to be treated like you do feel the same. Plus we had talked about the space thing and you never really being single before we got back together when reading the poetry book. It wasn‚Äôt a problem, but we said if it was something that came up we would work on it. It suddenly was a problem never spoken about in person and then ended without attempting to even have the possibility of working out the issue.\nSo then I feel confused and disposable again, though I would work through whatever you needed. ‚ÄúYou need space- a week alone and I don‚Äôt talk to you? Well, I‚Äôm gonna miss you, but if you really feel that‚Äôs what you need. Okay! see you next week lmk if you need anything. Just be ready to snuggle hard after ‚Äù.\nI‚Äôm so easy going. Often I just wanna be in your presence. I‚Äôll watch tik toks and get abs with you, lay in your lap while you read, or even happily sit in silence. But the time apart is great too, and finding a balance there is not impossible and should require little effort. I Just wanna be able to talk about life, put my hand on your thigh and give you a kiss occasionally.\nSo then maybe I‚Äôm misunderstanding, because after all that really the issue sounds like it is just being able to say you‚Äôre single?\nIf that‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm curious why you actually don‚Äôt like me.\nI know you have always been in a relationship, I have as well but I feel what we have is different and it‚Äôs whatever we want to create. We both share a lot of the same thoughts, feelings and experiences. We‚Äôre both easy going, self aware, capable of communicating and have enough bad experience we have grown from to be in honestly an incredibly unique position with not much effort required - just open communication. I don‚Äôt want to hold you back, I just occasionally want share my experiences and thoughts, to be near you and be intimate and laugh, simply enjoying each others company. And Who doesn‚Äôt like an occasional snug?\nBut maybe it‚Äôs something more deep,\nAnd I‚Äôm just not getting it.  If you‚Äôre set in that choice. Then I guess that‚Äôs how it has to be. I would really like to have a general conversation about everything though. Again, doesn‚Äôt have to feel like a huge thing. I don‚Äôt want anything feeling awkward or pressured/ want to avoid it. I just want you to feel comfortable, open and honest. It seems like when there‚Äôs something that‚Äôs big, or deemed inconvenient I feel that you just basically don‚Äôt want to deal with it and I totally get it. I want a drama free life, but I‚Äôm asking you to just be mindful of my feelings. If you don‚Äôt have the energy for it just say that or ‚ÄòI need time to think about this‚Äô, ‚Äòlong day today, can I get back to you later‚Äô really anything, it‚Äôs worse on me that you always have me silenced. When I never get a response back, overtime I keep sending more messages because I want to just have whatever is going on resolved and overthinking and feel I need to explain it different or something, but then when there‚Äôs more messages it‚Äôs overwhelming and some end up not getting responses as well which can lead me to feeling defeated and unheard, or maybe that you just don‚Äôt care even if that‚Äôs not your intention. I just end up questioning like did you even read it all, or did you just not bother because you don‚Äôt care. Just some insight there. I can‚Äôt tell you what to do, but I believe any response is better than none sometimes for me. I feel like that‚Äôs the area I struggle with and am fixing. I get at times certainly maybe I‚Äôve just being too much and it had deserved being ignored for sure. I‚Äôm really trying and working on my shit though. At a point you said you love me and I haven‚Äôt done wrong by you. I feel I‚Äôm deserving of your time effort. I would never put you on the backburner. Anyways. Love you, dude.

Realized that could of came across possibly rude- I just mean lmk when you‚Äôre going to bed or something bc tomorrow is my day off, so I was staying up and playing - last I knew I saw you in the kitchen grabbing ice cream.\nCollin: Give it a breakkkk.\nBruh. Every time you‚Äôre watching porn and shit I hear it. I‚Äôve been keeping quiet but it‚Äôs so fucking constant and for so long. I let you gaslight me in the past. I didn‚Äôt want it to be a thing and I prayed it would stop, but you jerk off kore than a teenage boy. I got proof\nPlease do it while I‚Äôm not here or wear some headphones or something.\nCollin: I still just have very strong feelings for you and I have to do my best going day to day pretending like everything is all good. But shits hard. It took over a year and a fuck ton of work before I was able to let my guard down and let someone in. I let it be you and when the guard came down I fell fast, I had fully committed.\nThat‚Äôs why I changed my routine and put an effort into making necessary improvements and would have done anything to make positive changes to our relationship. I really wanted something more with you. We had a pretty rough start, it was often awkward and stuff. There‚Äôs many factors to that, and I wish we would‚Äôve waited, but mostly I just wasn‚Äôt ready, I had that guard up - I never wanted to be heartbroken ever again. But I still wanted to be with you. Ive burnt bridges and without even thinking twice to keep you in my life and make sure you‚Äôre okay. I‚Äôve always just mindlessly wanted to be there for you. Just a different kind of connection, which I‚Äôm scared of loosing and is the only one I‚Äôve held onto and genuinely care about. I‚Äôve gotten rid of everyone else. When you agreed to get back together I was ready finally. I was excited and scared. I saw you much different now and genuinely imagined a future. I wanted to travel with you, go and meet your family and have you be more connected with mine because you would‚Äôve fit in perfect I just wanted to experience life with you and do my best to treat you how you deserve, when others in the past never did.  things feel easy and low pressure always with you.\nI wanted it to be different this time and I tried. We both did for a moment, Little by little it was better, but overall it was short, like a month? Not even?  I felt more emotion from you during that time. Genuinely thought you loved me at a point, but you got sick- spent time in your room for weeks and basically never came back out. I checked on you during my lunches. But I was just left waiting - you made false promises and broke up w me on my birthday when we were supposed to also go see one of my fav bands.. over text.. also after saying we would be hanging out that day and I had been trying to for the whole past week- also after saying that we would at least try to work through things and you were doing what you broke up with me for. It was a lot. It was extra tough bc I genuinely believed that we could get through anything. I never wanted to take any freedom or space away from you. Maybe just snuggle occasionally, hang out and support you. I love just being around you. So I felt so blindsided. We‚Äôve been through the shit, we‚Äôre grown, self aware and understand eachother I felt we were more than capable, and I thought we would be together for a long time, if not forever.  I really want no drama in life and plus I love you, I would‚Äôve done anything to make sure we were good. I just want to live a comfortable life and be in love. I never ask for much, if anything at all.\nYou‚Äôre just so different and special to me, I never have to walk on eggshells around you and I can be my genuine self, you get me like no one else does, I feel like I get you, I recognize you and see your worth+ value your unique personality and interests.

Wrapped alone within myself, it was a pious plight at self protection.\nWith this introspection, I‚Äôve found my most powerful ally. Her ghost and I, one and the same. Little me doesn‚Äôt need to fight any longer. She can rest and now it‚Äôs me who will be her keeper. Always balanced, pain and beauty, good and evil, sacrifice and conquest, love and loss- you choose which lens you look through. Humbly growing, I walk now with an open heart- I am an axis with no counterpart. My story so far- written in blue, my blood, my ink, my pen and paper.", "completion": "https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_njFzumpTUKpKfOD1VZjXhdPRw8I-FCDhc\nOur Sunday Affairs Presents: A 16 Song Step‚Äã-‚ÄãGuide On How To Lose What Made You Glow and Disappoint Everyone You Have Ever Loved\nA new music service with official albums, singles, videos, remixes, live performances and more for Android, iOS and desktop.

I feel a complete weight off my chest for real and feel something like i have never felt before. This was better than any feeling of sex or masturbation. This was feeling was literally nirvana and i had forgotten everything in the world at this point and felt so light and felt like i was flying. It was a completely different moment and i remembered everything tragic happening to me since the past year and how stressed i am these days about stupid shit.\n‚Äã\nTL;DR: I never knew I was able to retract my foreskin when flaccid or hard till I was 20, did it today after 20 years in the shower and had clunks of smegma all over the head which I had to pluck out and what follows is a state of nirvana.\nCollin: https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/19dze4s/tifu_by_not_pulling_my_foreskin_back_for_20_years/?share_id=VTQTKnz1ERFyjkdIjQFDd&utm_content=1&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&utm_source=share&utm_term=22\n[Mature Content] From the copypasta community on Reddit: TIFU by not pulling my foreskin back for 20 years (from r/tifu obviously)\nPosted by teruteru-fan-sam - 3 votes and 1 comment\nCollin: https://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/ke8skw/the_poop_knife/?share_id=lHQh_fh4IoBRZ-EWsNFMn&utm_content=1&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1\nFrom the MuseumOfReddit community on Reddit\nExplore this post and more from the MuseumOfReddit community\nCollin: Notes message:\nMovies bitch\nhttps://www.icloud.com/notes/0efQjGBNH4t_Vg7TXDtOlHflQ", "completion": "Will he front any white?", "timestamp_ms": 0}

I wish to clarify this situation and request the withdrawal of the eviction proceedings.\nAs you may recall, I had previously informed you that due to my pay schedule, I receive my income in the third week of each month, which affects the timing of my rent payments. Although we did not formally modify the payment schedule in our lease agreement, I have consistently made efforts to pay rent as promptly as possible given my financial circumstances.\nPlease find attached proof of payment showing that the rent for [Month/Year] was paid on [Date of Payment]. This includes [details of the proof of payment, such as bank statements or transaction details].\nGiven that the rent for the specified period has been paid, I respectfully request the immediate withdrawal of the eviction notice. I would greatly appreciate written confirmation acknowledging the receipt of my rent payment and the cessation of any eviction-related proceedings.\nI value my residence at [Your Address] and am committed to maintaining a good tenant-landlord relationship. I apologize for any inconvenience my late payments may have caused and am willing to discuss any potential solutions or arrangements that could assist in aligning our payment schedules more effectively.\nThank you for your understanding and attention to this matter. I am hopeful that we can resolve this misunderstanding promptly and am available for any further discussion if needed.\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Contact Information]\nCollin: /Users/collinzack/Library/Messages/Attachments/e0/00/at_0_CA0BD851-4DBD-4586-BCBF-37D26323410C/IMG_5124.jpg\nCollin: /Users/collinzack/Library/Messages/Attachments/e3/03/at_0_35BFCF40-B287-45BE-9A5B-8C0829D121F6/IMG_5125.jpg\nCollin: /Users/collinzack/Library/Messages/Attachments/11/01/at_0_B6DB2E8E-74CF-4B48-BBCA-629D10159A7D/IMG_5126.jpg", "completion": "So I have $900 of the rent, can you come up with $200 before the 5th?", "timestamp_ms": 0}

I didn‚Äôt take any of that out on you but my head is just filled with thoughts of being cheated on or the person going out and getting fucked up, or rly doing anything they can to hurt me.

I just want to go back to sleep at this point.\nCollin: \t1.\tConcern for Well-being: One party expressed concern for the other‚Äôs health due to apparent substance use. This concern is generally considered responsible and caring, especially if they believed the other person was at risk of an overdose.\n\t2.\tCommunication Breakdown: There was a significant breakdown in communication. One party felt dismissed and insulted when their concern was labeled as annoying or when they were accused of lying. The other felt wrongly accused and misunderstood, arguing that they were not in danger.\n\t3.\tBoundary Issues: Both parties had issues with boundaries. One wanted to set boundaries around how and when to discuss serious issues, especially when needing space. The other felt their immediate concerns were being ignored, which they perceived as a breach of mutual care and understanding.\n\t4.\tResponse to Concern: The response to expressed concern was met with defensiveness and accusations, which escalated the conflict. Instead of acknowledging the concern, the conversation turned into an argument about who was right or wrong.\n\t5.\tApologies and Acknowledgment: There were apologies made, but they were not fully accepted or acknowledged by the other party, leading to further frustration.\n\t6.\tUnderlying Issues: The conversation hints at deeper issues in the relationship, including previous patterns of behavior, the handling of substance use, and how arguments are conducted.\nCollin: For the person expressing concern:\n\t‚Ä¢\tAcknowledge the other‚Äôs perspective: Understand that their reaction might be influenced by their own experiences, perceptions, or the state they were in at the time. Acknowledging this doesn‚Äôt mean you agree with all aspects of their behavior, but it shows empathy.\n\t‚Ä¢\tExpress your feelings without blame: Use ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements to convey your feelings. For example, ‚ÄúI felt scared when I saw you in that condition‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúYou scared me by overdosing.‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\tClarify your intentions: Make it clear that your concern was for their safety and well-being, not to accuse or control them.\n\t‚Ä¢\tSeek to understand: Ask questions to understand their perspective better, rather than making assumptions or accusations.\nFor the person being confronted:\n\t‚Ä¢\tReflect on the concern: Even if you believe there was no risk, understand that the situation appeared dangerous to the other person. Acknowledging this doesn‚Äôt mean admitting to wrongdoing, but it recognizes their concern.\n\t‚Ä¢\tCommunicate your boundaries more effectively: If you need space or time to discuss serious matters, explain this calmly and clearly. Suggest alternative times or methods for discussing these issues.\n\t‚Ä¢\tAvoid defensiveness: While it‚Äôs natural to feel defensive, try to listen to the concerns without immediately dismissing them. This can open the door to more constructive dialogue.\n\t‚Ä¢\tWork on apology and reconciliation: If an apology is necessary, offer it sincerely. Discuss ways to prevent similar situations in the future.\nFor Both Parties:\n\t‚Ä¢\tTake a step back: Sometimes, taking a break from the conversation to cool down can prevent further escalation and allow both parties to approach the situation more rationally.\n\t‚Ä¢\tFocus on solutions: Instead of dwelling on who was right or wrong, focus on how to prevent misunderstandings in the future and how to better support each other.\n\t‚Ä¢\tConsider professional help: If communication continues to be a problem, consider seeking help from a counselor or therapist, individually or together.\n\t‚Ä¢\tWork on trust and understanding: Building mutual trust and understanding can help prevent future conflicts and misunderstandings.", "completion": "I‚Äôm not a computer so I don‚Äôt like when you chat got things.
